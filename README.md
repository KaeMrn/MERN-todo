# MERN-Todo

MERN-todo is a simple, interactive to-do list application. It's built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This application allows users to add, delete, and manage their daily tasks efficiently.

**This project aims to realise the following :**

⠀✓ a database to store users and task lists. \
⠀✓ a webpage (front-end) using Javascript technologies to display lists of tasks. \
⠀✓ an API (back-end) : \
⠀⠀⠀– to allow users to manage the DB (only for admin user) with `CRUD` operations. \
⠀⠀⠀– Authentification method to handle registrations and signins.
